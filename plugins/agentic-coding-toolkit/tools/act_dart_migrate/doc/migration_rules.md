# Migration Rules

This document explains the behavior of the bundled ACT tooling for Dart primary-constructor migrations. It is meant to help Regular ACT Users and LLM agents predict what the migration can change, what it will skip, and how to read the stable report vocabulary.

The migration is conservative. When it cannot prove that a rewrite preserves the meaning of the Target Package source, it leaves the source unchanged and reports a stable reason code.

## Supported Transforms

The public transform names are:

- `primaryConstructor`
- `constructorShorthand`
- `emptyClassBody`

`primaryConstructor` covers class primary-constructor migration, enhanced-enum primary-constructor migration, and extension type representation-parameter validation. For eligible classes and enhanced enums, it moves ordinary constructor boilerplate into Dart experimental primary-constructor syntax while preserving the declaration shape that matters to callers: modifiers, type parameters, bounds, clauses, unnamed, named, and `.new` constructor forms, parameter names, nullability, default values, `required`, private declaring parameter names, and simple `super` parameters.

The selected primary-constructor target may be unnamed, named, or `.new` when there is exactly one non-redirecting generative constructor that can be migrated safely. Retained redirecting constructors can remain in the body and be rewritten to constructor shorthand.

Supported parameter shapes include mapped field-formal parameters, typed field formals whose explicit type matches the field type, function-typed field formals whose explicit field declaration type can be copied to a declaring parameter, simple pass-through parameters, simple `super` parameters, optional positional parameters, named parameters, defaults, and `required`. Fields with implicit types are emitted as explicit `dynamic` declaring parameters when otherwise safe. Mutable covariant fields can become `covariant var` declaring parameters. Multi-variable field declarations are supported only when every variable in the declaration maps to a safe field-formal parameter and the declaration has no comments that would need to be split across parameters; partial mappings, initialized variables, unsafe field shapes, or commented multi-variable declarations are skipped.

Class and enhanced-enum primary-constructor migration may also move safe parameter-only field initializer assignments to field declarations. Constructor assertions may be retained in a primary constructor body when doing so preserves their order and meaning. Class migrations may also retain explicit super constructor initializers such as `super(...)` and `super.named(...)`.

By default, retained explicit super constructor initializers are migrated for maximum coverage. The opt-in `--skip-super-constructor-initializers` flag is a temporary Dart SDK primary-constructor workaround for a stable-channel compiler failure seen when a migrated class has both a primary constructor and an abstract superclass whose constructor has required parameters:

```dart
abstract class Parent {
  const Parent({required this.index});
  final int index;
}

class const Child(final int value) extends Parent {
  this : super(index: value);
}
```

When enabled, the flag skips otherwise eligible class migrations whose primary-constructor body would retain `super(...)` or `super.named(...)`. Super parameters such as `super.key` do not trigger that flag-specific skip.

Enhanced-enum primary-constructor migration preserves enum value argument shape and retained enum members such as methods, getters, factories, and static members. Named enum constructors can become named enum primary constructors when the enum has a single safe non-redirecting generative constructor target.

Extension type declarations already carry their primary constructor in the declaration header. The migration treats valid extension type primary constructors as supported fixed-point input, preserves omitted or explicit `final` representation parameters unchanged, and validates the representation parameter before applying safe extension-type body transforms. Extension types may retain additional body constructors; those constructors are not treated as a `multipleConstructors` primary-constructor skip.

`constructorShorthand` covers eligible generative and factory constructors that stay in class, enhanced-enum, or extension-type bodies but can be rewritten to constructor declaration shorthand. Primary-constructor migration is preferred when it is safe. Generative constructors use `new` shorthand, for example `C.name()` becomes `new name()`, `C()` becomes `new()`, and `C.new()` also becomes `new()`. Factory constructors remove the enclosing type name, for example `factory C.name()` becomes `factory name()`, `factory C()` becomes `factory()`, and `factory C.new()` becomes `factory()`. `const`, `external`, metadata, documentation comments, parameters, initializer lists, bodies, and redirected factory targets are preserved.

Constructor shorthand can still run after a primary-constructor skip when the skip is caused by constructor shape or metadata that does not make shorthand unsafe, such as `multipleConstructors`, `externalConstructor`, `namedConstructor`, `constructorMetadata`, `constructorComment`, or `parameterMetadata`. Extension type representation-parameter skips suppress constructor-shorthand and empty-body edits for that extension type declaration in the same run.

`emptyClassBody` collapses truly empty bodies to semicolon form for ordinary classes, mixin classes, mixins, extension types, extensions, and empty enums, including declarations made empty by primary-constructor migration. It does not remove bodies that contain comments, and it does not collapse enums that contain enum values or retained members.

Declarations that already use primary-constructor syntax are treated as unchanged. They are not failures, and they are not listed as migrated or skipped declarations.

## Safe No-Op Outcomes

A successful run can change no files. That can happen when all declarations are already in their fixed-point form, when the Target Package contains no eligible Dart declarations, or when every inspected declaration is conservatively skipped.

A skip-only result is also a successful run. It means the tool inspected source that was valid enough to analyze for migration planning, found only unsupported or unsafe shapes, and left the source unchanged on purpose.

## Declaration Skip Reasons

Declaration skip reasons are reported on skipped declaration records. They are grouped below by the cause users can act on.

Constructor shape:

- `multipleConstructors`: multiple non-redirecting generative constructors make one primary-constructor target ambiguous.
- `namedConstructor`: stable reserved reason code for named generative constructor shapes that are not supported as primary-constructor targets. Current class and enhanced-enum named constructors, including `.new`, are supported when they are the single safe non-redirecting generative target and do not conflict with retained members.
- `mixinClassPrimaryConstructor`: non-trivial mixin class primary constructors are not migrated.
- `primaryConstructorConflict`: the generated primary constructor name would conflict with a retained body member.
- `extensionTypeRepresentationParameter`: an extension type primary constructor does not have exactly one supported non-`var` representation parameter.
- `externalConstructor`: external constructors have no body that can be safely rewritten.
- `redirectingConstructor`: redirecting constructors are not migrated.
- `emptyNonConstConstructorWithMembers`: empty non-const constructors without parameters are only removed when the class body can safely collapse.

Constructor body and initializer safety:

- `nonEmptyConstructorBody`: the constructor body contains executable code that is not supported for movement.
- `fieldInitializingConstructorBody`: the constructor body initializes instance fields.
- `unsupportedConstructorBody`: the constructor body shape is not one of the supported shapes.
- `unsafeInitializerDependency`: moving a field initializer would require a value other than constructor parameters.
- `unsafeInitializerOrder`: moving field initializer assignments would change initializer evaluation order.
- `unsupportedInitializer`: an initializer entry is not supported.
- `superConstructorInitializer`: `--skip-super-constructor-initializers` skipped an otherwise eligible migration that would retain an explicit super constructor initializer as a Dart SDK primary-constructor workaround.
- `namedSuperInitializer`: stable reserved reason code for named `super` constructor initializer skips.

Metadata and comments that would move or disappear:

- `constructorMetadata`: constructor metadata is not moved to primary constructors.
- `constructorComment`: constructor comments are not moved to primary constructors.
- `parameterMetadata`: parameter metadata is not moved to declaring parameters.
- `fieldMetadata`: field metadata is not moved to declaring parameters.
- `fieldComment`: ambiguous field comments, including inline field-declaration comments that cannot be safely moved, are not moved to declaring parameters.
- `classBodyComment`: empty declaration bodies with comments are not collapsed away.

Field mapping and field declaration shape:

- `missingField`: a constructor parameter maps to no matching field.
- `staticField`: static fields cannot become declaring parameters.
- `lateField`: `late` fields cannot become declaring parameters.
- `externalField`: external fields cannot become declaring parameters.
- `initializedField`: fields that already have initializers are not converted to declaring parameters.
- `implicitFieldType`: stable reserved reason code for implicit field-type cases. Current safe implicit fields are emitted as explicit `dynamic` declaring parameters.
- `multipleFieldVariables`: partial or otherwise unsafe multi-variable field declarations are not converted to declaring parameters. All-mapped safe multi-variable field declarations can be converted.
- `unsupportedFieldModifier`: a field modifier is not supported for declaring parameters.
- `unsupportedParameterShape`: a constructor parameter shape is not supported.

## File And Directory Skip Reasons

Generated Dart files and skipped directory subtrees are reported separately from declaration skips.

- `generatedFile`: a Dart file is treated as generated source and is not inspected for declaration migration.
- `nestedPackage`: a subdirectory contains its own `pubspec.yaml`, so it is a separate package boundary when the parent package is the target.
- `nestedRepository`: a subdirectory is a nested repository or worktree boundary.
- `excludedDirectory`: a transient, hidden, or build-output directory is skipped as a whole.

The migration does not inspect Dart files inside skipped directories. Directory skips are reported once for the skipped subtree instead of once per file inside that subtree.

## Failure Versus Skip

Skips are expected conservative outcomes. They do not mean the tool crashed or that the Target Package is invalid.

A run fails only when the CLI cannot complete its migration pipeline, such as an invalid package root, parse failure in an inspected non-generated Dart file, transformed-source validation failure, bad arguments, or an unexpected internal error. In successful runs, unchanged files, no-op runs, and skip-only runs are all valid outcomes.
