# Architecture Overview

This document explains how ACT Dart Migrate moves from command-line input to a Migration Report. It describes responsibilities and boundaries, not stable private APIs.

ACT Dart Migrate is bundled ACT tooling shaped as one executable with Migration Subcommands. Its runtime job is intentionally narrow: inspect a Target Package, plan conservative source rewrites for the selected migration, validate those rewrites, write changed files when not in dry-run mode, and emit a stable report.

The first Migration Subcommand is `primary-constructors`.

## Package Shape

The package is a modular monolith:

- One executable: `act_dart_migrate`.
- Multiple Migration Subcommands over time.
- Shared internal core responsibilities for reusable mechanics.
- Migration-specific modules for language-feature behavior.

The stable surface is command behavior and report vocabulary. Private source files, classes, helper functions, and module boundaries may change as long as the external command contract and report contract remain stable.

## Shared Internal Core

The shared internal core owns mechanics that should be consistent across Migration Subcommands:

- Target Package root validation.
- Dart file discovery and deterministic path ordering.
- Generated-file, nested-package, nested-repository, and excluded-directory skipping.
- Dry-run behavior.
- Source-edit range validation.
- Descending offset edit application.
- Changed-file tracking.
- Stable exit-code categories.
- Report envelope conventions and stdout/stderr rules.
- Deterministic report arrays and count maps.

The shared internal core does not own language-feature-specific rewrite rules or skip vocabulary.

## Migration-Specific Modules

Migration-specific modules own behavior for one migration language feature:

- Migration prerequisites and experiment requirements.
- Analyzer feature flags when parsing or validation needs them.
- Transform rules.
- Declaration skip reason vocabulary.
- Migration-specific validation strategy.
- Fixture coverage for supported and skipped source shapes.

For `primary-constructors`, the migration module owns class and enhanced-enum primary-constructor rewrites, extension type representation-parameter validation, constructor declaration shorthand rewrites, empty class-body collapse, and the stable primary-constructor transform and skip reason codes.

## Pipeline

1. CLI argument handling selects a Migration Subcommand and target package run.
2. Target Package run orchestration validates the package root and coordinates shared discovery, migration-specific planning, error mapping, and report construction.
3. Discovery finds non-generated Dart files and records skipped files or directories before migration planning starts.
4. Migration-specific planning parses each discovered Dart file, plans declaration-level transforms, validates source edit ranges, and builds transformed source in memory.
5. Transformed-source validation parses every changed file in memory before any write occurs.
6. A real run writes only already-validated changed files; a dry run writes nothing.
7. Report serialization combines discovery facts, migration facts, stable transform names, skip reason codes, counts, and exit-facing errors.

## CLI Boundary

The CLI owns:

- Target Package root validation.
- Dart file and skipped-path discovery.
- Dispatch to recognized Migration Subcommands.
- Conservative migration planning for supported transforms in the selected migration.
- Source edit range validation before edits are applied.
- Parse-before-write behavior for inspected input files.
- Validation-before-write behavior for changed output files.
- File writes for non-dry-run migrations.
- Stable JSON and text report generation.

The CLI does not own formatting, target package analysis, target package tests, package setup commands, git operations, or rich human presentation workflows. Those steps sit outside the executable so migration planning remains local, deterministic, and easy to validate from the report.

ACT-owned orchestration surrounds the CLI. It can prepare the environment, invoke the bundled executable, read the JSON report, format changed Dart files, run target-package analysis and tests, bootstrap bundled tooling dependencies, and manage git workflow after the CLI exits. Keeping those concerns outside this package prevents the migration report from hiding unrelated setup, formatting, verification, dependency, or git failures.

## Discovery

Discovery walks the target root in deterministic order, includes non-generated Dart files, and records skipped paths before migration planning receives any files.

Generated Dart files are skipped because rewriting generated source would fight the generator that owns those files. Nested packages are skipped because a child `pubspec.yaml` marks a separate Target Package boundary. Nested repositories and worktrees are skipped because they are separate source-control boundaries. Transient, hidden, and build-output directories are skipped as whole subtrees so their contents are not parsed or reported one file at a time.

Discovery output separates files to inspect from skipped files and skipped directories. Later stages use those facts to build `skippedFiles`, `skippedDirectories`, and combined skip counts in the final report.

## Target Package Run Orchestration

Target Package run orchestration normalizes and validates the target root, calls discovery, runs the selected migration, maps migration failures to public error codes, and creates the success report.

This orchestration is the seam between CLI argument handling and migration planning. Tests can replace file-system access or parsing at this boundary without making runtime behavior depend on a different production implementation.

## Migration Planning

For `primary-constructors`, the planner parses each discovered Dart file with the primary-constructor experiment enabled, then routes top-level classes, mixin classes, enums, extension types, extensions, and mixins through the applicable primary-constructor, constructor-shorthand, and empty-body planning paths.

Planning is conservative. It creates source edits only for supported shapes and records skipped declarations with stable reason codes for unsupported or unsafe shapes. Class primary-constructor migration, enhanced-enum primary-constructor migration, constructor shorthand, and empty class-body collapse are planned through the same file-level path so their edits and report facts are combined deterministically.

If an inspected input file cannot be parsed, the run fails before any changed file is written. That parse-before-write behavior prevents a partially migrated package when input source is invalid.

## Source Edits

Source editing validates range bounds and rejects overlapping edits before building transformed source.

Migration planners produce edit intents; source editing applies them in a stable order. This keeps syntax decisions in the migration planners and raw text-edit safety in one reusable module.

## Transformed-Source Validation And Writes

The migration engine builds all changed file contents in memory before writing anything. Every changed source is parsed again with the primary-constructor experiment enabled.

If transformed-source validation fails, the run returns a validation failure and writes no files. This validation-before-write behavior is separate from source edit range validation: edit validation proves the text edits are structurally safe to apply, while transformed-source validation proves the resulting Dart file is parser-valid.

When validation succeeds, non-dry-run mode writes the changed files. Dry-run mode returns the same planning and report facts without writing files.

## Reports

Report serialization keeps public transform names, declaration skip reason codes, file and directory skip reason codes, deterministic sorting, combined counts, success JSON, failure JSON, and concise text output stable.

The report is the integration contract between the CLI and surrounding ACT orchestration. It is also the right place for users and agents to look when they need to understand what changed, what was skipped, and why a run failed.

## Analyzer-Valid Regression Support

Analyzer-valid regression coverage is a test-only responsibility area. It should exercise representative fixture packages through the normal migration path and then prove the migrated output remains valid with analyzer APIs.

That support must stay out of the production CLI boundary. Runtime migration uses parser validation and report facts; analyzer-valid regression tests provide release confidence without expanding what the executable does to a Target Package.

## Stability Of This Overview

The stable surface is the CLI behavior and report vocabulary, not private helper classes or private methods inside these modules. Future refactors may reorganize implementation details as long as the public command behavior, conservative write boundary, and report contract remain intact.
